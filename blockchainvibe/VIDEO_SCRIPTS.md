# Video Scripts for Colosseum Hackathon Submission

## ðŸ“¹ Pitch Video Script (< 3 minutes)

### Video Structure: 2 minutes 45 seconds

---

### [0:00-0:15] Opening Hook (15 seconds)

**Visual**: Logo animation â†’ Platform overview

**Script**:
> "Information overload. That's the problem we face every day in the blockchain ecosystem. With hundreds of news sources, thousands of articles, and limited timeâ€”how do you stay informed without drowning in noise?"

**Screen**: Show problem visualization - multiple news sources, overwhelming feeds

---

### [0:15-0:45] Team Background & Why We Built This (30 seconds)

**Visual**: Team members (if available) or platform demonstration

**Script**:
> "I'm [Name], and our team has been building in the blockchain space for [X] years. We've experienced firsthand the frustration of trying to stay current with crypto news. Traditional aggregators just dump everything on youâ€”no intelligence, no personalization, no understanding of what actually matters to you.
>
> That's why we built BlockchainVibe: an AI-powered news platform that doesn't just aggregateâ€”it understands. Using Fetch.ai uAgents and SingularityNET's MeTTa Knowledge Graph, we've created a system that actually learns what you care about and delivers the news that matters most."

**Screen**: Platform interface, personalized feed examples

### [0:45-1:15] Market Opportunity (30 seconds)

**Visual**: Market statistics, user personas

**Script**:
> "The opportunity is massive. The blockchain news market serves over 300 million crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Current solutions treat everyone the sameâ€”but we don't consume information the same way. A DeFi trader needs different news than an NFT collector or a protocol developer.
>
> Our target market includes:
> - Active crypto traders needing real-time insights
> - DeFi protocols monitoring ecosystem developments
> - Blockchain developers staying current with tech updates
> - Crypto investors tracking market-moving news
>
> We're not just building a news aggregatorâ€”we're building an intelligence layer for the entire blockchain ecosystem."

### [1:00-1:40] Feature Prioritization & Key Features (40 seconds)

**Visual**: Feature highlights, user experience flows

**Script**:
> "We prioritized features that solve real user problems. First: **Intelligent Aggregation**. Our News Fetcher Agent continuously monitors 50+ blockchain sources, scoring articles for quality and relevance.
>
> Second: **Real-time Personalization**. Instead of requiring users to manually set preferences, our system learns from behaviorâ€”every like, bookmark, and read tells the AI what you care about.
>
> Third: **Knowledge Graph Integration**. The MeTTa integration lets users discover connections they wouldn't find elsewhereâ€”see how these Solana articles are connected to DeFi protocols and NFT projects.
>
> Fourth: **Seamless User Experience**. OAuth authentication, dark mode, mobile-responsive designâ€”we built for real users, not just demo videos."

### [1:40-2:20] Technical Decisions & Architecture (40 seconds)

**Visual**: Architecture diagrams, code snippets (if appropriate), agent integration

**Script**:
> "Let me explain our key technical decisions:
>
> **Why Fetch.ai uAgents?** We needed autonomous agents that could process news continuously, not just on-demand. Our News Fetcher Agent runs 24/7, monitoring RSS feeds and scoring content. The Relevance Scorer Agent personalizes content based on user profiles. Both agents communicate through Chat Protocol, making them discoverable on ASI:One.
>
> **Why MeTTa Knowledge Graph?** Traditional news aggregators are flatâ€”articles don't connect. MeTTa lets us extract entities, understand relationships, and surface related content users wouldn't find otherwise. This creates a knowledge web, not just a news feed.
>
> **Why Cloudflare?** We needed global performance and edge deployment. Cloudflare Workers handle our backend API, while Cloudflare Pages delivers our frontend worldwide. The result: sub-200ms load times globally.
>
> **Why React + Styled Components?** We prioritized developer experience and user experience equally. React provides component reusability, while Styled Components give us theme-based design that adapts to light and dark modes seamlessly."

>
> Our MeTTa Knowledge Graph includes extensive Solana entity mappingâ€”protocols, NFTs, DeFi projects, and key players. This means Solana users get the most comprehensive coverage available.
>
> We're also exploring direct Solana integration for future features like on-chain news verification and protocol-governed content curation."
