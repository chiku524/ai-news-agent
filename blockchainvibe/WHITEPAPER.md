## 1. Introduction

The blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem generates an enormous volume of news, articles, and information daily. With over 50+ major news sources publishing hundreds of articles per day, users face a critical challenge: how to find the most relevant, timely, and valuable content among the noise.

Traditional news aggregation platforms rely on simple algorithms like chronological sorting or basic keyword matching, failing to understand user preferences, article context, or relevance beyond surface-level metrics. This results in information overload, missed opportunities, and suboptimal user experiences.

BlockchainVibe addresses these challenges by combining state-of-the-art AI technologies to create an intelligent news aggregation platform that understands both content and users, delivering personalized recommendations powered by autonomous agents and knowledge graphs.

### 1.1 Vision

To become the leading AI-powered platform for blockchain news consumption, providing users with the most relevant, timely, and valuable content from the entire blockchain ecosystem through intelligent curation and personalized recommendations.

### 1.2 Mission

To democratize access to quality blockchain information by leveraging artificial intelligence to filter, categorize, and personalize news content, enabling users to stay informed about the blockchain space efficiently and effectively.
